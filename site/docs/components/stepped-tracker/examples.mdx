## Basic

`SteppedTracker` contains multiple `TrackerStep` child components. Each `TrackerStep` indicates its current status through its icon and color. In addition, the connectors indicate the current active step and the user’s progress through the process.

You can add a label to the `TrackerStep` using the `StepLabel` component.

## Stage and Status

`SteppedTracker` supports multiple `stage` and `status` values for each `TrackerStep` child component.

Available `stage` values are `"pending"` and `"completed"`. **Note:** `"active"` is not a valid value: the active step is defined by the `activeStep` prop on the `SteppedTracker` component.

Available `status` values are `"warning"` and `"error"`.

When stage and status are both set, the order of precedence for which icon is show is as follows: "completed" > "active" > "error|warning" > "pending"

## Vertical

You can vertically orientate a stepped tracker, with labels displayed on the right of the icon in the step node.

### Best practices

Use a vertical stepped tracker when horizontal space is limited in the context of the application or when there are a large number of steps in the process – for example, more than 8.

## Nested Vertical

Vertically orientated stepped trackers can be nested. Nesting is achieved by use of the `depth` prop on the `TrackerStep` component. Up to 2 levels of nesting are supported.

When a step has nested children, the step icon will show an "in progress" icon when some of the children are completed, and a "completed" icon when all children are completed.

Nesting is only supported in vertical orientation.

### Best practices

While sub-steps support the use of descriptive text and long labels, it's recommended to keep the labels short and concise to preserve the visual calarity of nested steps.

## Step progression

In normal circumstances, once the user completes a step, you should advance the active step, and change the status of the current active step in unison.

## Nonsequential progress

It may not be appropriate in some circumstances, but it's possible to control the state of steps and the active step independently if users can revisit previous steps or complete steps nonsequentially.
