## Main tabstrip (default)

The main tabstrip uses a border to separate the tabs from the rest of the page. You can align tabs inside the tabstrip can be aligned to the left, center or right. Use it to organize content across the main region of an interface under the app header.

### Best practices

The main tabstrip should span the width of the page.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="MainTabstrip" />

## Inline tabstrip

The inline tabstrip has no separator between the tabs and the content below. Use it within an area of a page to switch between related content. Like the main tabstrip, you can align the tabs to the left, center or right.

### Best practices

Don’t use inline tabs standalone outside of the content region it is nested within.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="Inline" />

## With icon

[Icons](../icon) are optional and appear to the left of the label text. An icon can effectively signify the tab’s purpose, as it relates to its underlying content. Additional visual aid makes it easier for users to locate tabs.

### Best practices

Ensure that icon descriptors are used consistently across all tabs within the strip. This helps keep the tabs within the strip equally weighted.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="WithIcon" />

## With badge

Tabs can feature a [badge](../badge) that serves as a visual cue. They can inform users of additional context, notifications, or new content.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="WithBadge" />
